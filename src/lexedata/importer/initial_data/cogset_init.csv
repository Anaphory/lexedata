At present, I can't tell. Wayãpi and Émérillon aren't that far apart, so even if it happened at the time of the common ancestor, this wouldn't be very long ago (a few hundred years). But it is not clear where this ancestor was spoken: if in the same general area, the borrowing could have happened then; but if it was much more to the south, then this ancestor would not have been in contact with local Cariban languages (yet) and the borrowing would have to have happened independently in Wayãpi and in Émérillon.

So, in sum: I can't tell. My gut feeling is that the borrowing occurred at the time of the ancestor (why would both languages borrow a word for 'breast/milk'?), but it's only a gut feeling with nothing to support it. -SM"
