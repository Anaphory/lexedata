At present, I can't tell. Wayãpi and Émérillon aren't that far apart, so even if it happened at the time of the common ancestor, this wouldn't be very long ago (a few hundred years). But it is not clear where this ancestor was spoken: if in the same general area, the borrowing could have happened then; but if it was much more to the south, then this ancestor would not have been in contact with local Cariban languages (yet) and the borrowing would have to have happened independently in Wayãpi and in Émérillon.

So, in sum: I can't tell. My gut feeling is that the borrowing occurred at the time of the ancestor (why would both languages borrow a word for 'breast/milk'?), but it's only a gut feeling with nothing to support it. -SM"

PG, poi 'soltar') and /mbo+ir/ 'separate' (mo = causative). Some languages exhibit a 'doubly causativized' form of the latter. The question that has occupied us is whether are two cognate sets or one, in particular, whether there is one set based on the above set of forms and, in addition, a /mbo-'i/ (CAUS-small) set. This issue is raised by the fact that some languages have forms w/ and w/o a final r (in languages that preserve them), and also have forms w/ and w/o a glottal stop. We have decided to merge the two sets, pending discussion w/ Fran re: the seemingly distinct Eme forms -- LDM

The individual languages seem to vary a lot on how many stems there are, and on whether they are all ""forms of the same stem"" or independent verbs -- so it's not clear to me WHAT was innovated (longer forms from shorter forms? shorter forms from longer forms?) and whether the different stems are to be reconstructed as independent lexems ('characters') or as forms of the same lexeme ('subcharacters') -- /ap/ vs. /up/ vs. /aw/? /ap/ and /aw/ vs. /up/? /ap/, /aw/ and /up/ as one?...

So I'd treat the positional verbs with great care -- their history is potentially confusing.
